# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Drones

What do you know about?
I know how to build a FPV Drone.

What decisions do you face?
The fact that i cant fly due to the quarentine

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation:

The price of a drone is way cheaper in China than any other part of the world.

2. Trend related to the news:

Drones are helping prevent the spread of COVID-19 and in some countries they're also being used to
enforce social distancing.

3. Who does that?

Theres is a huge growing sport in the sports industry in countries within europe
and the US. Where Drone pilots have won up to $1mil in one day.

in some countries in europe, Drones are being used by law enforcement to 
enforce social distancing and also to fumigate to help the spread of COVID-19

4. Answering a question people care about:

What personal use can i do with a drone?

A drone can used for entertainment or to take photos or videos from an aerial perspective. 
If you like to travel, hiking or camping you could use your drone to capture one of the
most beautiful footages that you can imagine and take shots from a bird-view which
could be imposible with a normal camera if you're not in an airplane itself.

5. Valuable to businesses:

Drones could be use to perform local deliveries.
Today, companies like walgreens, CVS and other 
pharmaceutical business are delivering drugs 
other medical suplies in rural areas in the US.
As a prevention to the spread of COVID19 and
social distancing.


Drones could be very helpful in farming and monitoring by air. 
Farms and telecom towers companies for example are using drone to performe
inspections on their product\land, as like telecom companies use it to
to spot areas where maintenence is needed. Reducing the time to
get the job done and replacing the expensive costs of
helicopters and human labor.

It'is also a tool being used by realtors to showcase their homes for sale
in a very fancy and professional way.

Its a very useful tool for agriculture. Drones are being use to fertilize, plant seeds and keeping farms healthy 
in a low cost and cutting the time than using human labor.

6. What's the most popular?

FPV Drones are the most popular with a bigger use\demand and fan base.

7. Cost/Money rankings:

The most expensive drones are the ones used from agriculture. 
They can range from $4,000 to $25,000. Due to the quality, size of the frame
and really solid parts to be able to perform these hard works of agriculture.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Building a drone is hard or difficult.

Drones are very easy to build. If you follow along
with the many YouTube videos on youtube you can easily build your own
UAV aircraft.

However, flying it is a different story.

Flying it could take months of practice or perhaps 
taking a drone pilot class. Just know that if you start
flying an FPV drone for the first time theres a 90% chance
that you will crash it or break it before it even takes off
the ground.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

From DS 2:
Mac Scheffer, Play Calling in the NFL: The Road to Improvement

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Yes

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Yes

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Yes

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

on kaggle.com\datasets
reddit\datasets
also Github

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

3D Printing

What do you know about?

I know how to 3D print properly and the right way.

What decisions do you face?

If i would be able to find any data on this topic.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation:

In countries where weapons are illegal. Some people 
use their 3D printer ro print guns.

2. Trend related to the news:

As the goverment is trying to ban the sales of guns is the US,
the people are turning to 3D printing as an alternative to 
have one.


3. Who does that?

People that lives in countries or states where the sales of guns are illegal.



4. Answering a question people care about:

A 3D printer could be used to print most of the 3d object that you can think of.

Specially plastics objects. Even thought there is printers that have the capability
of printing metal as well.

5. Valuable to businesses

A 3D printing could be so helpful for broken parts or even
creating a tool that may help you get the job done.



6. What's the most popular?

The most popular 3D printer is the creality Ender 3.
They are one of the most common in the market, therefore
the community is one of the biggest one for support and
it is also one of the cheapest 3D printers in the market.

7. Cost/Money rankings

They have different models and size.

The cheapest one could start of at $200
ranking to one of better ones with a bigger bed size
up to $700.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That 3D printing is as easy as it looks.

That is the mentality of anybody joining the hobby
and then they realize that it takes a lot of practive,
training, fail prints to even get the first line of layer to 
stick to the build plate.

## Idea conlusion:

The idea that i'm leaning towards is the Drone. Because i have more years of experence building drones and as a certified drone pilot.
